              JAE SVN is an Argentine singer, rapper, songwriter and music
              producer. He first started learning guitar and being passionate
              about songwriting around the age of 8. During his teenage years,
              he took an interest in hip-hop and music production. As a result
              of his involvement with music, the HEPTAGON Project was founded in
              2020. Two years later, he released his two first songs, Discord
              and 1000 Miles.
